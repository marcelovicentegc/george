Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. If your change corresponds to a issue or a feature related to a [milestone](ROADMAP.md), please let us know.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface if necessary (this includes new environment
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters).
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
