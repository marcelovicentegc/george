## Software directions

| General steps                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Install Node.js on Raspberry -> Set a MQTT broker on Raspberry -> Set a MQTT client on Application |

## Configure the Raspberry Pi's O.S. through a remote machine

1. [Get Raspberry Pi's O.S. lite (server) version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
2. [Follow the instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)
3. Enable `ssh` (disabled by default for security reasons) by creating a `ssh` folder inside the disk's root
4. Set up a [DHTP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol)
5. Start Raspberry Pi
6. Get Raspberry Pi's IP address <ip_address>
7. ssh into it: `ssh pi@<ip_address>`
   - Password: `raspberry`
8. _pi@raspberrypi_ Change current password: `passwd`
9. _pi@raspberrypi_ Update and upgrade the O.S.:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get upgrade`
10. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install git: `sudo apt-get install git`
11. _pi@raspberrypi_ Set time to local time: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
12. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install Node (Debian approaches versioning differently than Node's, and in this case `apt-get` straight away is not the best option):
    - `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
      - Note: if you get stuck on `[Connecting to archive.raspberrypi.org (etc...)]`, try:
        - `sudo apt-get -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true update`
        - `sudo apt-get -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true -y dist-upgrade`
        - Note that `-o Acquire::ForceIPv=true` can be used for stucked installs as well
    - `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
    - `node -v`
    - `npm -v`
13. **If willing to set a minimum decent development environment on the Raspberry [RECOMMENDED, otherwise handling johnny-five and raspi-io can get quite over complicated], install VS Code (Code-OSS)**:
    - `wget https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds/gpgkey -O - | sudo apt-key add -` or `sudo apt-get install code-oss=<version>` [check version here](https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds)
    - `curl -L https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh | sudo bash`
14. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install Nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx`
15. _pi@raspberrypi_ Adjust the Firewall: `sudo ufw app list`
16. _pi@raspberrypi_ Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/marcelovicentegc/home-automation-model.git`
17. Install yarn:
    - `curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
    - `echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list`
    - `sudo apt update`
    - `sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn`
    - `yarn --version`
18. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install dependencies:

    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn add johnny-five raspi-io & yarn add -D @types/johnny-five`

19. _pi@raspberrypi_ Reboot: `sudo reboot`
20. _pi@raspberrypi_ Start the application: `pm2...`

### [raspi-io](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io)

### [MQTT](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/software?id=software) (Message Queue Telemetry Transport, a.k.a. Mosquitto by the Python community)

IoT **connectivity protocol** that can be used to glue devices together.

MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M) data transfer protocol. MQTT was created with the goal of collecting data from many devices and then transporting that data to the IT infrastructure. It is lightweight, and therefore ideal for remote monitoring, especially in M2M connections that require a small code footprint or where network bandwidth is limited.

MQTT is a publish/subscribe (PubSub) protocol that allows edge-of-network devices to publish to a broker. Clients connect to this broker, which then mediates communication between the two devices. **Each device can subscribe, or register, to particular topics**. When another client publishes a message on a subscribed topic, the broker forwards the message to any client that has subscribed.

MQTT is bidrectional, and maintains stateful session awareness. If an edge-of-network device loses connectivity, all subscribed clients will be notified with the "Last Will and Testament" feature of the MQTT server so that any authorized client in the system can publish a new value back to the edge-of-network device, maintening bidirectional connectivity.

## Hardware directions

### Controllers

- [ESP controller](https://www.google.com/search?q=esp+controller&oq=esp+controller&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3.4142j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
  - ESP controllers are the conductors of the application and they orchestrate the application's logic and responses to client requests. Via `action` functions, they receive client requests and generate appropriate responses, mutating the applications data model as required.
    An ESP controller is a `C` source file that contains action functions to receive incoming client requests and manage the applications response. The controller may be part of an ESP MVC application or it may be a stand-alone controller. [Source](https://www.embedthis.com/esp/doc/users/controllers.html).
  - Connects to [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network).

### Relays

A relay is an electrally operated _switch_. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating pricnipals are also used, such as solid-state relays. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.
