#### Implement ESP8266 support

This milestone will be done when:

- Connection between multiple ESP8266 and main server are stable
- Device state data is being stored on database
- Views reflect the actual state accurately
- Add module schematic

ðŸš€ &nbsp;**OPEN** &nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‰ &nbsp;&nbsp;**0 / 3** goals completed **(0%)** &nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“…

#### Energy consumption insights

This milestone will be done when:

- Input for kwH/\$ configuration is available
- Metrics about energy consumption of each supported device is available
- Dashboard for energy consumption visualization is available

ðŸš€ &nbsp;**OPEN** &nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“‰ &nbsp;&nbsp;**0 / 3** goals completed **(0%)** &nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸ“…

#### Integrate with A.I. assistants

For now, further investigation is needed.
