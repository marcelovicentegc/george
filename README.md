# Software directions

## Configure the Raspberry Pi's O.S. through a remote machine:

1. [Get Raspberry Pi's O.S. lite (server) version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
2. [Follow the instructions](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)
3. Enable `ssh` (disabled by default for security reasons) by creating a `ssh` folder inside the disk's root
4. Set up a [DHTP server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol)
5. Start Raspberry Pi
6. Get Raspberry Pi's IP address <ip_address>
7. ssh into it: `ssh pi@<ip_address>`
   - Password: `raspberry`
8. _pi@raspberrypi_ Change current password: `passwd`
9. _pi@raspberrypi_ Update and upgrade the O.S.:
   - `sudo apt-get update`
   - `sudo apt-get upgrade`
10. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install git: `sudo apt-get install git`
11. _pi@raspberrypi_ Set time to local time: `sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
12. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install Node (Debian approaches versioning differently than Node's, and in this case `apt-get` straight away is not the best option):
    - `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -`
      - Note: if you get stuck on `[Connecting to archive.raspberrypi.org (etc...)]`, try:
        - `sudo apt-get -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true update`
        - `sudo apt-get -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true -y dist-upgrade`
        - Note that `-o Acquire::ForceIPv=true` can be used for stucked installs as well
    - `sudo apt-get install nodejs`
    - `node -v`
    - `npm -v`
13. **If willing to set a minimum decent development environment on the Raspberry [RECOMMENDED, otherwise will you have problems handling johnny-five and raspi-io], install VS Code (Code-OSS)**:
    - `wget https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds/gpgkey -O - | sudo apt-key add -` or `sudo apt-get install code-oss=<version>` [check version here](https://packagecloud.io/headmelted/codebuilds)
    - `curl -L https://code.headmelted.com/installers/apt.sh | sudo bash`
14. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install Nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx`
15. _pi@raspberrypi_ Adjust the Firewall: `sudo ufw app list`
16. _pi@raspberrypi_ Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/marcelovicentegc/home-automation-model.git`
17. Install yarn:
    - `curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
    - `echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list`
    - `sudo apt update`
    - `sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn`
    - `yarn --version`
18. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install dependencies:

    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn add johnny-five raspi-io & yarn add -D @types/johnny-five`

19. _pi@raspberrypi_ Reboot: `sudo reboot`
20. _pi@raspberrypi_ Install PostgreSQL: `sudo apt-get install postgres`
21. _pi@raspberrypi_ Start the application: `pm2...`

## Configure the Raspberry Pi's O.S. on a Hyper-V V.M.:

1.  [Get Raspbian Pi Desktop's ISO version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-desktop/)

4.  Name the V.M.

    ![Name the V.M.](docs/3.jpg)

5.  Specify its generation

    ![Specify its generation](docs/4.jpg)

6.  Specify the amount of RAM to allocate to the O.S. (note that Raspberry Pi's manufacture RAM is of 1024MB).

    ![Specify the amount of RAM](docs/5.jpg)

7.  Select the network adapter that you want to connect with this V.M. so it have access to internet (usually, the `External Virtual Switch`).

    ![Select the network adpater](docs/6.jpg)

8.  Select the size of the virtual hard disk for the V.M.

    ![Select the size of the virtual hard disk](docs/7.jpg)

9.  Reference the downloaded ISO

    ![Reference the downloaded ISO](docs/8.jpg)

10. Now, wait the wizard create the Raspbian's V.M. on Hyper-V

    ![Raspbian's V.M. creation](docs/9.jpg)

11. Once the V.M. has been created, start it

    ![Start Raspbian](docs/10.jpg)

12. On Raspbian O.S. installation wizard, select the `Graphical install` option and press `return`

    ![Raspbian O.S. installation wizard options](docs/11.jpg)

13. Select your preferred language

    ![Select your preferred language](docs/12.jpg)

14. Set the disk partition up: select `guided - use entire disk`, and continue

    ![Set the disk partition up](docs/13.jpg)

15. It will warn you that all the data on the test will be arranged. Continue

    ![Warn](docs/14.jpg)

16. Select the first option `All files in one partition`, and continue

    ![Partition options](docs/15.jpg)

17. Proceed to the summary of the partition setup, and select `Finish partitioning and write changes to disk`

    ![Partition summary](docs/16.jpg)

18. Confirm the changes by selecting `Yes`

    ![Partition confirmation](docs/17.jpg)

19. Wait for Raspbian's install

    ![Wait for Raspbian's install](docs/18.jpg)

20. Select `Yes` for the GRUB bootloader install prompt

21. Specify the location you want to install the GRUB bootloader (usually, the second option)

    ![Specify the GRUB bootloader's location](docs/20.jpg)

22. Once the installation is completed, the wizard will notify it

# Hardware directions

## Controllers

- [ESP controller](https://www.google.com/search?q=esp+controller&oq=esp+controller&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3.4142j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
  - ESP controllers are the conductors of the application and they orchestrate the application's logic and responses to client requests. Via `action` functions, they receive client requests and generate appropriate responses, mutating the applications data model as required.
    An ESP controller is a `C` source file that contains action functions to receive incoming client requests and manage the applications response. The controller may be part of an ESP MVC application or it may be a stand-alone controller. [Source](https://www.embedthis.com/esp/doc/users/controllers.html).
  - Connects to [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network).
  - Have ports

### Connectivity protocols

## Transistors

## Relays

A relay is an electrally operated _switch_. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating pricnipals are also used, such as solid-state relays. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

## Use cases

| Case             | Communication steps                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Eletric bulbs    | Broker -> Controller -> Relay -> Device               |
|                  | Broker -> Controller -> Transistor -> Relay -> Device |
| Infrared devices | Broker -> Controller -> Infrared emissor -> Device    |
