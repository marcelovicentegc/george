## Raspberry Pi as a web server

1.  Install `ufw`: `sudo apt install ufw`

2.  Set up default Firewall policies

- `sudo ufw default deny incoming`
- `sudo ufw default allow outgoing`

3.  Allow SSH connections: `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH`

4.  Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable`

5.  Check it's status: `sudo ufw status verbose`

6.  Install `nginx`: `sudo apt-get install nginx`

7.  Allow HTTP connections: `sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'`

8.  Start the server: `sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start`

9.  Get the Raspberry's IP address: `hostname -I`

10. Make sure the web server is up and running: `systemctl status nginx` should return

    ```shell
    ‚óè nginx.service - A high performance web server and a reverse proxy server
    Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Fri 2018-04-20 16:08:19 UTC; 3 days ago
        Docs: man:nginx(8)
    Main PID: 2369 (nginx)
        Tasks: 2 (limit: 1153)
    CGroup: /system.slice/nginx.service
            ‚îú‚îÄ2369 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;
            ‚îî‚îÄ2380 nginx: worker process
    ```

11. Set up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy Server: - Open `/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com` for editing:

    - Replace the contents of the `location /` block

            . . .

                location / {
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
                    proxy_http_version 1.1;
                    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                    proxy_set_header Host $host;
                    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
                }
            . . .

12. Test the webserver by heading to the Raspberry's IP

13. Install [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/) (a process manager for Node.js applications): `sudo npm install pm2@latest -g`

14. Clone the git repository: `git clone https://github.com/<user>/<project>.git`

15. Change directory into <project>: `cd <project>`

16. Install dependencies: `yarn install`

17. Build the application: `yarn build`

18. Test the application
    - `yarn launch`
    - `curl http://localhost:4000`
19. Run the `<project>`'s main application in the background: `NODE_ENV=production pm2 start dist/server/index.js`
20. Applications that are running under PM2 will be restarted automatically if the application crashes or is killed, but we can take an additional step to get the application to launch on system startup using the `startup` subcommand. This subcommand generates and configures a startup script to launch PM2 and its managed processes on server boots: `pm2 startup systemd`

    - The last line of the resulting output will include a command to run with superuser privileges in order to set PM2 to start on boot:

    ```shell
    [PM2] Init System found: systemd
    [PM2] To setup the Startup Script, copy/paste the following command:
    sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi
    ```

    - Run the command from the output: `sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u pi --hp /home/pi`

21. As an additional step, we can save the PM2 process list and corresponding environments: `pm2 save`

22. Start the service with `systemctl`: `sudo systemctl start pm2-pi`

    - Note: if this command raises an error, reboot the server (`sudo reboot`) and run it again as soon as you ssh in.

23. Check the status of systemd unit: `systemctl status pm2-pi`

24. Managing PM2:

    - Stop an application: `pm2 stop <app_name_or_id>`
    - Restart an application: `pm2 restart <app_name_or_id>`
    - List applications currently managed by PM2: `pm2 list`
    - Get information about a specific application using its `App name`: `pm2 info <app_name>`
    - The PM2 process monitor can be pulled up with the `monit` subcommand. This displays the application status, CPU, and memory usage: `pm2 monit`

25. Managing the Nginx Process:

    1. To stop the web server: `sudo systemctl stop nginx`
    2. To start the web server: `sudo systemcl start nginx`
    3. To stop and start the service again: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
    4. To reload the service without dropping connection: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`
    5. By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior by typing: `sudo systemctl disable nginx`
    6. To re-enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable nginx`

26. Setting up Server Blocks:

    1.  Add a server block to `example.com`: `sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com`

        ```
            server {
                listen 80;
                listen [::]:80;

                    root /home/pi/project/dist/index.html;
                    index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

                    server_name example.com www.example.com;

                    location / {
                            try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                    }
            }
        ```

    2.  Enable the file by creating a link from it to the `sites-enabled` directory, which Nginx reads from during startup: `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled`
    3.  To avoid possible hash bucket memory problem that can arise from adding additional server names, it is necessary to adjust a single value in the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file. Open it (`vi` or `nano`) and find the `server_names_hash_bucket_size` directive and uncomment that line.
    4.  Test for syntax errors in any of Nginx files: `sudo nginx -t`
    5.  Restart Nginx to enable the changes: `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

## Node.js libraries

### [johnny-five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five)

Makes it simple (Javascript way) to interact with Pi's hardware.

Bryan Hughes - _The JQuery of robotics. A physical web UI._

It communicates with Raspberry Pi through the Firmata Protocol

Sources: [Getting Started with the Johnny-Five Robotics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqdbglIRRJA&list=PL9z6q1fnu6aBbcgDRXlzAmqAf9MsTaRJk)

### [raspi-io](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io)

### [MQTT](https://github.com/mqtt/mqtt.github.io/wiki/software?id=software) (Message Queue Telemetry Transport, a.k.a. Mosquitto by the Python community)

IoT **connectivity protocol** that can be used to glue devices together.

MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M) data transfer protocol. MQTT was created with the goal of collecting data from many devices and then transporting that data to the IT infrastructure. It is lightweight, and therefore ideal for remote monitoring, especially in M2M connections that require a small code footprint or where network bandwidth is limited.

MQTT is a publish/subscribe (PubSub) protocol that allows edge-of-network devices to publish to a broker. Clients connect to this broker, which then mediates communication between the two devices. **Each device can subscribe, or register, to particular topics**. When another client publishes a message on a subscribed topic, the broker forwards the message to any client that has subscribed.

MQQT is bidrectional, and maintains stateful session awareness. If an edge-of-network device loses connectivity, all subscribed clients will be notified with the "Last Will and Testament" feature of the MQTT server so that any authorized client in the system can publish a new value back to the edge-of-network device, maintening bidirectional connectivity.

### Installing MQTT broker

1. Update the O.S.: `sudo apt update`
2. Install Mosquitto: `sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients`
3. Enable Mosquitto to start on boot: `sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service`
4. Check Mosquitto's version: `mosquitto -v`
5. To use the Mosquitto broker, you'll need your Raspberry Pi's IP address, check it out by typing: `hostname -I`

### Testing the MQTT broker

1. Install Mosquitto's client: `sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients`
2. Run Mosquitto as a daemon: `mosquitto -d`
3. Subscribe to a `testTopic`: `mosquitto_sub -d -t testTopic`
4. Open another terminal and publish a message to `testTopic`: `mosquitto_pub -d -t testTopic -m "Hello world!"`
5. Open one more terminal and subscribe to `testTopic`: `mosquitto_sub -d -t testTopic`
6. Again, on the second window, publish another message to `testTopic`: `mosquitto_pub -d -t testTopic -m "Hello world again!"`
7. Unsubscribe topic: `mosquitto_sub -t testTopic -U testTopic -v`

### Installing Redis Server

1. Update the O.S.: `sudo apt update`
2. Install Redis: `sudo apt-get install redis-server`
3. Enable Redis to start on system boot: `sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service`
4. If you need to make any changes to Redis configuration, head to: `/etc/redis/redis.conf`

   - I.g.: If you need to adjust the max memory limit used by Redis, you can update it by `sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf`ing and altering the `maxmemory` line.

5. After configuring it, restart it: `sudo systemctl restart redis-server.service`
6. Test connection:

```bash
  $ redis-cli

  127.0.0.1:6379> ping
  PONG

## Controllers

- [ESP controller](https://www.google.com/search?q=esp+controller&oq=esp+controller&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i65l3.4142j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
  - ESP controllers are the conductors of the application and they orchestrate the application's logic and responses to client requests. Via `action` functions, they receive client requests and generate appropriate responses, mutating the applications data model as required.
    An ESP controller is a `C` source file that contains action functions to receive incoming client requests and manage the applications response. The controller may be part of an ESP MVC application or it may be a stand-alone controller. [Source](https://www.embedthis.com/esp/doc/users/controllers.html).
  - Connects to [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network).

## Relays

A relay is an electrally operated _switch_. Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operate a switch, but other operating pricnipals are also used, such as solid-state relays. Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by a separate low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. The first relays were used in long distance telegraph circuits as amplifiers: they repeated the signal coming in from one circuit and re-transmitted it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.
